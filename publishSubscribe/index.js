/**
 * Examples of the implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern
 *
 * EventEmitter represents the publish-subscribe pattern directly from the box
 * But still there are different approaches of using it and all of them pursue some goal.
 * Also they enforce main principles of software design which are:
 * - single point of responsibility
 * - encapsulation
 * - DRY
 *
 * and the biggest benefit that is achieved when we use events is loosely coupling of our code.
